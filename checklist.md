Check list for software documentation

- Is there a plain text README file that accompanies the software and which explains what the program does and who created it?
- Is there a comprehensive manual available somewhere that describes what every option of the program does?
- Is there a clear version number or release date for the software?
- Does the software provide clear installation instructions (where relevant) that actually work?
- Is the software accompanied by an appropriate license?
- For command-line programs, does the program give some sensible output when no arguments are provided?
- For command-line programs, does the program give some sensible output when -h and/or --help is specified (see this old post of mine for more on this topic)?
- For command-line programs, does the built-in help/documentation agree with the external documentation (text/PDF), i.e. do they both list the same features/options?
- For script based software (Perl, Python etc.), does the code contain a reasonable level of comments that allow someone with relevant coding experience to understand what the major sections of the program are trying to do?
- Is there a contact email address (or link to support web page) provided so that a user can ask questions and get more help?
